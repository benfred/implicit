## v0.5.0

### Breaking API Changes

The API for implicit has substantially changed in v0.5.0 - and any code written for the previous
API will need to be rewritten:

* Change model.fit to take a user_items sparse matrix [#484](https://github.com/benfred/implicit/pull/484)
* Return numpy arrays from recommend methods [#482](https://github.com/benfred/implicit/pull/482)
